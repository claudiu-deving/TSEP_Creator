# TSEP Creator

### Tekla Structures Extensions Package Creator

Automatically detect and package the dependencies of your project into a .tsep file that can be installed into Tekla Structures.

The Product Name, version and all the other info is to be set in the main assembly.
User for version only the first three (v.1.2.3 instead of v.1.2.3.4) otherwise the TSEP won't accept it.

Play around with the path to the Parent directory in order to match the project root.

Ideally this would be transformed into a tool of its own. (maybe in the future)
